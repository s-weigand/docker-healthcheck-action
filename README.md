# Docker Container Health Check

GitHub Action for checking the status of a Docker container.

## Usage

### Get the status of a container

To query the status of a container, pass the container name (or id) to the action:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - name: Get container status
        uses: stringbean/docker-healthcheck-action@v3
        id: missing-container
        with:
          container: unknown
      - run: echo "Container is ${{ steps.missing-container.outputs.status  }}"
```

This will output "Container is not-running".

### Waiting for a container to become healthy

To wait for a container to become healthy, pass in the required status &
`require-healthy: true`:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - name: Start container
        run: docker run -d --rm --name hello-world crccheck/hello-world
      - name: Wait for container
        uses: stringbean/docker-healthcheck-action@v3
        with:
          container: hello-world
          wait-time: 50
          require-status: running
          require-healthy: true
```

This will start the `hello-world` container and wait for it to pass a health
check. If the container takes longer than 60 seconds to become healthy it will
fail the build.
